/**
 * This module provides an interface to the garbage collector used by
 * applications written in the D programming language. It allows the
 * garbage collector in the runtime to be swapped without affecting
 * binary compatibility of applications.
 *
 * Using this module is not necessary in typical D code. It is mostly
 * useful when doing low-level memory management.
 *
 * Notes_to_implementors:
 * $(UL
 * $(LI On POSIX systems, the signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 and reserved
 *   by this module for use in the garbage collector implementation.
 *   Typically, they will be used to stop and resume other threads
 *   when performing a collection, but an implementation may choose
 *   not to use this mechanism (or not stop the world at all, in the
 *   case of concurrent garbage collectors).)
 *
 * $(LI Registers, the stack, and any other memory locations added through
 *   the $(D GC.$(LREF addRange)) function are always scanned conservatively.
 *   This means that even if a variable is e.g. of type $(D float),
 *   it will still be scanned for possible GC pointers. And, if the
 *   word-interpreted representation of the variable matches a GC-managed
 *   memory block's address, that memory block is considered live.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to scan the non-root heap in a precise
 *   manner, so that fields of types like $(D float) will not be considered
 *   relevant when scanning the heap. Thus, casting a GC pointer to an
 *   integral type (e.g. $(D size_t)) and storing it in a field of that
 *   type inside the GC heap may mean that it will not be recognized
 *   if the memory block was allocated with precise type info or with
 *   the $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_SCAN)) attribute.)
 *
 * $(LI Destructors will always be executed while other threads are
 *   active; that is, an implementation that stops the world must not
 *   execute destructors until the world has been resumed.)
 *
 * $(LI A destructor of an object must not access object references
 *   within the object. This means that an implementation is free to
 *   optimize based on this rule.)
 *
 * $(LI An implementation is free to perform heap compaction and copying
 *   so long as no valid GC pointers are invalidated in the process.
 *   However, memory allocated with $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_MOVE)) must
 *   not be moved/copied.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations must support interior pointers. That is, if the
 *   only reference to a GC-managed memory block points into the
 *   middle of the block rather than the beginning (for example), the
 *   GC must consider the memory block live. The exception to this
 *   rule is when a memory block is allocated with the
 *   $(D GC.BlkAttr.$(LREF NO_INTERIOR)) attribute; it is the user's
 *   responsibility to make sure such memory blocks have a proper pointer
 *   to them when they should be considered live.)
 *
 * $(LI It is acceptable for an implementation to store bit flags into
 *   pointer values and GC-managed memory blocks, so long as such a
 *   trick is not visible to the application. In practice, this means
 *   that only a stop-the-world collector can do this.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to assume that GC pointers are only
 *   stored on word boundaries. Unaligned pointers may be ignored
 *   entirely.)
 *
 * $(LI Implementations are free to run collections at any point. It is,
 *   however, recommendable to only do so when an allocation attempt
 *   happens and there is insufficient memory available.)
